# FEATURES

Methods:
Normalize Features
  - normalize extracted features (0.0-1.0) - arg: global min/max
Get Global Min Max
    - for normalization across datasets
Extract Features
  - methods to extract 7 features from a 785 column csv

The 7 features from each MNIST image:
1. Density
2. Symmetry
3/4. Max/Avg Horizontal Intersections
5/6. Max/Avg Horizontal Intersections
7. Connected components (circles)
